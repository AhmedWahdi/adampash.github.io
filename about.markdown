My name is Adam Olin Pash. I grew up in [a small town in Iowa](http://www.cityofharlan.com/) (great web site), went to school in Iowa City, lived in Los Angeles, CA for eight years, and currently live in Brooklyn, NY. 

I've done a lot of things on the internet, but if you've heard of any of them, it's probably [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com). I've also written for a number of other publications, like Wired, Popular Science, and PC World, and I've written [a couple of books](http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Pash/e/B001JRYOY6/). 

I'm currently building things with code. You can follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adampash) or check me out [on GitHub](https://github.com/adampash/). You can email me at \[first.last\] at gmail.com and I'll get back to you asap.

You're visiting my blog, and [this is what my blog is about](/2013/09/24/i%27m-blogging-again/).
