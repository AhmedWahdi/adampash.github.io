Hi internet! I've got news: 

I'm blogging again!

I haven't written anything on you since I [left Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5973647/it-was-pash-like-cash) at the beginning of this year, and while you may not have noticed my absence, I certainly have, and I've missed it. I've considered writing the occasional freelance article for various publications, but the catch is, you have to write things that one of those publications is sure their readers will care about. That's not what this blog is.

Instead, this is a blog in the early-2000s sense. A personal blog. I hope that you'll find a lot of it interesting, but ultimately the focus will be &ldquo;things Adam is interested in.&rdquo; Maybe we'll find some overlap!

Here's what you can expect, should you choose to read the occasional post here:

* I won't break news, but I may write a long post about something happening in the news, and you might feel compelled to share it along with some words of praise, like &ldquo;smart take.&rdquo; I won't make fun of you for resorting to a clich√©; that's a super nice thing to say. 
* I won't clog your newsreader (which is what we call them again because you don't use Google Reader anymore) with hundreds of posts a week. I plan on writing roughly one post every week, so you can [subscribe to my feed](TK) without considering it much of a commitment.
* Occasionally I may say something stupid. Sorry about that. I promise that at the time I wrote it, I probably thought it was a previously mentioned &ldquo;smart take,&rdquo; or at least thought there was some truth to what I was saying. I'll try to do better next time.
* I will occasionally review products and/or services that I'm interested in, but this isn't the Wirecutter. 

I'm 32, I'm funemployed, and I'm starting a blog.not blog nouveau
You know how some ppl write posts on Facebook or MEDIUM? This is like that, but it's found at adampash.com rather than medium.com
