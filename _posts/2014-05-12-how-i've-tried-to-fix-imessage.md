I've gotten many, many helpful emails and tweets regarding [iMessage purgatory post](/imessage-purgatory/) offering tips for how to fix this problem (people are great). Unfortunately, I've already tried everything that people have suggested (so far, at least).

For the record, I still have my old iPhone, so I can easily swap the SIM card back into it and perform common fixes. Here are at least a few of the things I've tried:

* Reset my Apple ID password
* Log out of Messages and FaceTime on all my devices
* Text STOP to 48369
* Remove my device from My Support Profile (https://supportprofile.apple.com/)

The phone number in question is not associated with my Apple ID anymore. If I log into my Apple account in the Messages setting, that number doesn't show up as a send/receive option. But on the iDevices of my friends and family, that number still appears to be associated with iMessage.

If you've got a suggestion I haven't listed above, let me know! I've tried a lot over the past week, so I'm sure there are a couple I've forgotten about. I'm also not including terrible solutions, like "have everyone you know delete you as a contact and re-add you" or "have everyone you know delete all previous conversations with you." Incidentally, I've tried these things on Ellen's phone and she still can't send me a text.
